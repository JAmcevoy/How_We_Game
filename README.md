# Welcome to How We Game

- This Python script is designed to conduct a gaming survey and manage the administrative tasks associated with the collected data. Users can participate in the survey by providing their gaming preferences, and administrators can perform various actions such as counting users for each console, analyzing satisfaction ratings, and assessing user loyalty.

### User Survey and Data Collection Module
- Whats is this? 
    - This is a Survey setup around gamers.
- What is the aim of this software    
    - To find out what console people are currently playing.
    - To find out what is the most popular console based on age groups
    - Find out how loyal players are to their console of choice.

## User Hopes

- As a user I hope the software is easy to understand
- As a user I want to limit the amount errors unhandled
- As a user I would want constant information to ensure I am filling the survey out correctly.

## Features

- **User Survey** : Users can participate in the survey by answering questions about their preferred gaming console brand, satisfaction rating, age group, and loyalty choice.
- **Admin Panel** : Administrators have access to an admin panel where they can perform various actions based on user input. Actions include counting users for each console, analyzing satisfaction ratings, and assessing user loyalty.

## Prerequisites

- Google Sheets API Credentials
- Python 3
- Required Python libraries (install using pip install -r requirements.txt):
    - gspread
    - google-auth

## Python Script Overview/Pseudo Code

The provided code is a Python script that implements a simple survey system related to gaming preferences and console usage. The script utilizes Google Sheets for data storage and interaction. Here's a summary of the main components and functionalities:

### Google Sheets Integration

- The script uses the `gspread` library to interact with Google Sheets.
- Google Sheets API credentials are set up using a service account file (`creds.json`).
- The script opens a specific Google Sheets document named 'how_we_game' to store survey responses.

### Constants

- The script defines some constants such as the administrator password (`ADMIN_PASSWORD`) and valid console choices (`VALID_CONSOLE_CHOICES`).

### Mapping Dictionaries

- Dictionaries (`LET_TO_CONSOLE`, `LET_TO_AGE`, `LET_TO_LOYALTY`) are used to map user choices (e.g., 'A', 'B') to corresponding labels (e.g., 'Xbox', '25-34', 'Likely').

### Question Prompts

- A dictionary named `QUESTION_PROMPTS` stores prompts for various survey questions. Each key in the dictionary corresponds to a question, and the associated value is the prompt.

### User Input Validation

- Functions like `handle_invalid_choice` and `validate_satisfaction_rating` handle the validation of user inputs.

### User Survey Functions

- The `user_questions` function collects survey responses from users, validates inputs, and updates the Google Sheets document accordingly.

### Admin Panel Functions

- The `admin_questions` function provides an admin panel to perform various actions based on user input, such as counting users for each console, getting the count of users with ratings above/below a threshold, and counting users likely to stay with their current console brand.

### Export to CSV

- The script includes a function (`export_results_to_csv`) to export survey results to a CSV file.

### Main Function

- The main function serves as the entry point of the script, calling the `user_login` function to prompt users to choose between a regular user and an admin.

### Conditional Execution

- The script includes an `if __name__ == "__main__":` block to ensure that the main function is executed when the script is run.


## Usage

- **Google Sheets Setup:**
    - Create a Google Sheet named 'how_we_game.'
    - Share the sheet with the email address specified in    your Google Sheets API credentials.
- **Credentials:**
    - Obtain the creds.json file containing your Google Sheets API credentials.
    - Install Dependencies:
- **Survey Participation:**
    - Users can participate in the survey by selecting their preferences.
- **Admin Panel:**
    - Administrators can access the admin panel by providing the correct password.
    - Admins can choose from various actions to analyze survey data.
- **Error Handling:**
    - The script handles errors gracefully, providing informative messages to guide users and admins.
- **Data Persistence:**
    - User survey responses are appended to the Google Sheet for ongoing data analysis.

### Survey Questions:
- `console_brand`: Preferred gaming console brand (Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, PC).
- `satisfaction_rating`: Satisfaction rating on a scale of 1 to 10.
- `age_group`: Age group (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45+).
- `loyalty_choice`: Likelihood to stick with the current gaming console brand (Likely, Neutral, Unlikely).

  - Key: `CREDS` (all capital letters)
  - Value: Copy the entire content of the `creds.json` file from your Gitpod workspace.
  - Click "Add."

**Note:** The `creds.json` file is necessary for connecting to the API, and this config var ensures it's available during Heroku app deployment.

#### Buildpacks

- Go to the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the "Buildpacks" section.
- Add two buildpacks:
  1. Select "Python" and click "Save changes."
  2. Select "node.js" and click "Save."

Ensure the buildpacks are in the correct order: Python on top, and node.js underneath. Adjust the order if needed.

- Choose "Github" as the deployment method.
- Connect to your Github account and search for your repository name.
- Connect your Heroku app to your Github repository.

#### Deployment Method

Choose one of the following deployment methods:

- **Automatic Deploys:** Heroku will rebuild your app every time you push a new change to your Github repository.
- **Manual Deploy:** Manually deploy using the "Deploy Branch" option. This option allows you to show deployment logs as the app is built.

### 4. Monitor Deployment

- Watch the deployment logs to ensure a successful build.
