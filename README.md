# Welcome to How We Game

- This Python script is designed to conduct a gaming survey and manage the administrative tasks associated with the collected data. Users can participate in the survey by providing their gaming preferences, and administrators can perform various actions such as counting users for each console, analyzing satisfaction ratings, and assessing user loyalty.

### User Survey and Data Collection Module
- Whats is this? 
    - This is a Survey setup around gamers.
- What is the aim of this software    
    - To find out what console people are currently playing.
    - To find out what is the most popular console based on age groups
    - Find out how loyal players are to their console of choice.

## User Hopes

- As a user I hope the software is easy to understand
- As a user I want to limit the amount errors unhandled
- As a user I would want constant information to ensure I am filling the survey out correctly.

## Features

- **User Survey** : Users can participate in the survey by answering questions about their preferred gaming console brand, satisfaction rating, age group, and loyalty choice.
- **Admin Panel** : Administrators have access to an admin panel where they can perform various actions based on user input. Actions include counting users for each console, analyzing satisfaction ratings, and assessing user loyalty.

## Prerequisites

- Google Sheets API Credentials
- Python 3
- Required Python libraries (install using pip install -r requirements.txt):
    - gspread
    - google-auth

## Usage

- **Google Sheets Setup:**
    - Create a Google Sheet named 'how_we_game.'
    - Share the sheet with the email address specified in    your Google Sheets API credentials.
- **Credentials:**
    - Obtain the creds.json file containing your Google Sheets API credentials.
    - Install Dependencies:
- **Survey Participation:**
    - Users can participate in the survey by selecting their preferences.
- **Admin Panel:**
    - Administrators can access the admin panel by providing the correct password.
    - Admins can choose from various actions to analyze survey data.
- **Error Handling:**
    - The script handles errors gracefully, providing informative messages to guide users and admins.
- **Data Persistence:**
    - User survey responses are appended to the Google Sheet for ongoing data analysis.

### Survey Questions:
- `console_brand`: Preferred gaming console brand (Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, PC).
- `satisfaction_rating`: Satisfaction rating on a scale of 1 to 10.
- `age_group`: Age group (18-24, 25-34, 35-44, 45+).
- `loyalty_choice`: Likelihood to stick with the current gaming console brand (Likely, Neutral, Unlikely).

## Functions:
- `handle_invalid_choice()`: Prints a message for invalid choices.
- `validate_satisfaction_rating(answer)`: Validates the satisfaction rating input.
- `get_user_choice(prompt, valid_choices)`: Gets and validates user input based on a prompt and valid choices.
- `user_questions(SHEET)`: Collects user survey responses, validates inputs, and stores the data in a Google Sheet.
- `admin_questions(SHEET)`: Admin panel to perform various actions based on user input, such as console count, rating count, and loyalty count.
- `user_login(SHEET)`: Allows users to log in as a regular user or an admin, guiding them through the survey or admin functionalities.
- `update_worksheet(data, worksheet_name, SHEET)`: Updates the Google Sheet with user survey responses.
- `console_count(SHEET)`: Counts the number of users for each gaming console and provides the count.
- `get_rating(SHEET)`: Gets the count of users with ratings higher or lower than a specified threshold.
- `get_loyalty_count(SHEET)`: Counts the number of users likely to stay with their current console brand and provides the count.

## Constants and Configuration: 
- ADMIN_PASSWORD: Password to access the admin panel.
- VALID_CONSOLE_CHOICES: Set of valid choices for console preferences.

## Deployment

### 1. Create a Heroku App

- From the Heroku dashboard, click the "Create new app" button.
- Name your app (e.g., how-we-game) â€“ ensure the name is unique.
- Choose your region (e.g., Europe) and click "Create app."

### 2. Configure App Settings

#### Config Vars

- Go to the "Settings" tab on your Heroku app dashboard.
- Locate the "Config Vars" section.
- Add a new config var:
  - Key: `CREDS` (all capital letters)
  - Value: Copy the entire content of the `creds.json` file from your Gitpod workspace.
  - Click "Add."

**Note:** The `creds.json` file is necessary for connecting to the API, and this config var ensures it's available during Heroku app deployment.

#### Buildpacks

- Go to the "Settings" tab and scroll down to the "Buildpacks" section.
- Add two buildpacks:
  1. Select "Python" and click "Save changes."
  2. Select "node.js" and click "Save."

Ensure the buildpacks are in the correct order: Python on top, and node.js underneath. Adjust the order if needed.

### 3. Deploy from Github

- Go to the "Deploy" tab on your Heroku app dashboard.
- Choose "Github" as the deployment method.
- Connect to your Github account and search for your repository name.
- Connect your Heroku app to your Github repository.

#### Deployment Method

Choose one of the following deployment methods:

- **Automatic Deploys:** Heroku will rebuild your app every time you push a new change to your Github repository.
- **Manual Deploy:** Manually deploy using the "Deploy Branch" option. This option allows you to show deployment logs as the app is built.

### 4. Monitor Deployment

- Watch the deployment logs to ensure a successful build.
- Verify the installation of Python, dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`, and node.js.

### 5. Test the Deployed App

- Once the deployment is successful, click the provided link to view your deployed app.
- Test the functionality of your app, ensuring that it operates as expected in the deployed environment.

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed the **How We Game Survey** project to Heroku. Verify that your app functions correctly in the live environment, and refer to the deployment logs for troubleshooting if needed.


## Constraints

The deployment terminal is set to 80 columns by 24 rows. That means that each line of text needs to be 80 characters or less otherwise it will be wrapped onto a second line.
